Template of Oracle APEX application

Template contains a number of database objects (tables, triggers, procedures, etc.) and APEX objects (pages, build options, authentication scheme, etc.). It allows you to develop an application with different access models (simple role-based, RBAC, ABAC).
Functions, already implemented in this template:
 * custom authentication scheme
 * all supporting database objects for authentication scheme (package with functions to create user, check password, etc.)
 * pages for access rights tuning
 * default ADMIN user for application

Also you can use this template for creating multiple applications in one APEX workspace.
